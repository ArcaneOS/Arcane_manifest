[SIZE="4"][b][color=#1a73e8]What is this?[/color][/b][/SIZE]
[SIZE="3"]* ArcaneOS is a simple rom, fueled by Pixel Experience that aims to be simple yet cunning. ArcaneOS provides necessary
  customizations that is needed for every day life, from your traffic indicator down to your favorite icon styles. 
  While also promising to be simple, ArcaneOS was made to be aesthetic without making its users go through a lot 
  of configurations. ArcaneOS is a fan of simplicity. We strive to keep the ROM bloatfree and fast.

* This custom ROM has no affiliations or connections to the ArcaneOS described here:(https://www.xda-developers.com/fbi-backdoor-pixel-arcaneos-anom). The brand name was inspired by the terminology "Arcane" from the game called "dota 2".

Based on Android 11
